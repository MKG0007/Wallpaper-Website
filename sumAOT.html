                The story of Attack on Titan follows humanity's fight for survival against monstrous, human-eating Titans that have driven civilization to the brink. Set in a world where the last remnants of humanity live within three massive walls, the narrative spans a complex exploration of freedom, oppression, and human nature. Here's a broad summary of the story.

            The Wall and the Titans: Humanity has spent over a century living behind massive walls (Wall Maria, Wall Rose, and Wall Sina) to keep out Titans—gigantic humanoid creatures who devour humans. Eren Yeager, along with his friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert, grows up within Wall Maria, questioning this existence and dreaming of exploring the outside world.

The Fall of Wall Maria: Eren’s life changes when the Colossal Titan breaches Wall Maria, allowing Titans to pour into the city. His mother is killed by a Titan in front of him, and he swears revenge, vowing to kill every Titan. Eren, Mikasa, and Armin join the military and become part of the Survey Corps, a branch dedicated to exploring outside the walls and battling Titans.

Eren's Titan Powers: During a mission, Eren discovers he can transform into a Titan himself, a revelation that both terrifies and fascinates those around him. This power turns him into a critical asset but also a target, as others fear his abilities. As the Survey Corps investigates, they learn more about the mysterious Titans and the secrets of the walls.

The Mystery of the Titans: The story delves into a deep conspiracy as it becomes clear that the Titans and even the walls themselves are part of a larger plot. Eren’s power is linked to the "Coordinate," a mysterious ability that can control Titans, and his father’s basement supposedly holds secrets about the Titans and humanity’s past.

Marley and Eldia: Eventually, the protagonists discover that they are not the last humans but part of the Eldian race, living in isolation due to the nation of Marley. Marley uses Eldians, who can turn into Titans, as both weapons and tools of oppression. The conflict turns political and global, with Eren and the Survey Corps facing the reality of a world beyond the walls and the ongoing oppression of Eldians by Marley.

War Against Marley: Eren and his friends launch a strike against Marley, intending to protect Eldia by taking the fight to their enemies. In a brutal and morally complex war, Eren’s character becomes increasingly radical as he takes drastic actions to ensure Eldia’s survival, even if it means mass destruction.

The Rumbling: With his powers fully realized, Eren enacts the “Rumbling”—an apocalyptic plan using the Titans within the walls to flatten the world outside. His goal is to wipe out any threat to Eldia once and for all. The Survey Corps members are divided on Eren's actions, leading some of his closest friends to fight against him to prevent mass genocide.

The Final Confrontation and Legacy: Eren’s former allies, including Mikasa and Armin, ultimately confront him in a bid to end the destruction. Through sacrifice, they manage to stop him, and with his death, the power of the Titans disappears, freeing humanity from their terror.

Post-Rumbling World: The world begins to rebuild after Eren’s death, though tensions remain between Eldians and the rest of humanity. The story concludes with humanity trying to build a new future, free from the Titans and the cycle of hatred that Eren had tried to end.
